# Cryptocurrencies

In this project I am using unsupervised machine learning to create a report of different cryptocurrencies that are trading in the market, and to create visualizations that show how these digital currencies could be grouped in order to create a classification system for potential new investments.

The code used in this project accomplishes the following:

- Preprocessing the Data for PCA
- Reducing Data Dimensions Using PCA
- Clustering Cryptocurrencies Using K-means
- Visualizing Cryptocurrencies Results
